3. Be specific: "I want to work on GitHub issue #5"
4. Share error messages exactly as they appear
5. Ask for step-by-step guidance

### Authentication and API Issues

**‚ùå "Exit code 1" when tagging @claude in GitHub issues:**

1. **Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY setup**:
   - Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret exists
   - Get new key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) if needed

2. **Check API Budget**:
   - Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) ‚Üí Billing
   - Verify you have available API credits ($10+ recommended)
   - Set monthly limit to prevent overuse

3. **Test GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   gh auth status    # Should show "Logged in"
   gh repo view      # Should show your repo, not error
   ```

**‚ùå GitHub CLI authentication problems:**

```bash
# Re-authenticate GitHub CLI
gh auth logout
gh auth login
# Follow prompts: GitHub.com ‚Üí HTTPS ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Web browser login
```

**‚ùå Supabase connection errors:**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy Project URL and anon key
3. Update `.env.local` with correct values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
4. Restart development server: `npm run dev`

### Financial Setup Reminders

**Critical for GitHub Integration:**
- Ensure you have API budget configured at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
- Minimum $10 recommended for active development
- Claude Code needs API credits to create GitHub issues and use @claude tagging
- Set monthly limits to control spending
- Check usage regularly during active development periods

### Deployment and Hosting Issues

1. Check environment variables are set correctly
2. Verify database connection works
3. Test locally with `npm run build` first
4. Ask Claude Code to help debug specific errors
