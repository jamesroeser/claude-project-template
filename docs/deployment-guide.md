# Deployment Guide - PROJECT_NAME

## Overview

This guide walks through deploying your PROJECT_NAME application using Vercel, connecting a custom domain (optional), and configuring automatic deployments from GitHub.

**The Modern Deployment Pipeline:**

**GitHub → Vercel → Your Domain** creates a professional deployment workflow:

- **GitHub**: Version control and collaboration
- **Vercel**: Hosting optimized for Next.js applications  
- **Custom Domain**: Professional appearance (yoursite.com vs random-name.vercel.app)

## Prerequisites

Before starting deployment:

- [x] PROJECT_NAME repository on GitHub
- [x] Vercel account (free) connected to GitHub
- [x] Domain name (optional - Vercel provides free subdomains)
- [x] Project working locally (`npm run build` succeeds)

## Step 1: Connect GitHub to Vercel

Setting up automatic deployments from your repository.

### Initial Setup

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and log in with GitHub
2. Click "New Project" 
3. Select your `PROJECT_NAME` repository
4. Configure project settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - **Root Directory**: `./` (default)
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build` (default)
   - **Output Directory**: `.next` (default)

### Environment Variables

5. Add environment variables (click "Environment Variables"):
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```
   
   **Optional variables:**
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_... (for payments)
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_... (for payments)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-... (for analytics)
   ```

6. Click "Deploy"

### Verification

- **Build Success**: Check deployment logs for any errors
- **Site Access**: Your app is now live at `https://random-name.vercel.app`
- **Functionality Test**: Verify key features work in production

## Step 2: Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

Making your website accessible at your custom domain instead of a random Vercel URL.

### In Vercel Dashboard

1. Go to your project → Settings → Domains
2. Add domain: `yourdomain.com`
3. Add subdomain: `www.yourdomain.com` (recommended for SEO)

### DNS Configuration

Vercel will provide DNS instructions for your domain provider:

**Recommended Setup:**
```
A Record: @ → 76.76.19.19 (Vercel's IP)
CNAME Record: www → cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**What these records do:**
- **A Record**: Points your main domain (yourdomain.com) to Vercel's servers
- **CNAME Record**: Points www.yourdomain.com to Vercel's content delivery network

### Domain Provider Examples

**Namecheap:**
1. Login → Domain List → Manage
2. Advanced DNS → Add records as shown above

**GoDaddy:**
1. DNS Management → Add records as shown above

**Cloudflare:**
1. DNS → Add records (ensure proxy is disabled for initial setup)

### Verification

- **SSL Certificate**: Vercel automatically generates HTTPS certificates
- **Domain Access**: Test both yourdomain.com and www.yourdomain.com
- **Redirect Setup**: Configure www → non-www or vice versa in Vercel

## Step 3: Automatic Deployments

Every push to your main branch automatically updates your live website.

### How It Works

1. **Code Push**: You commit and push code to GitHub
2. **Auto-Build**: Vercel detects changes and starts building
3. **Quality Checks**: Build process runs tests and validation
4. If build succeeds, new version goes live at your domain
5. **Rollback Available**: Previous version can be restored instantly

### Branch Strategy

- **main branch**: Automatically deploys to your production domain
- **develop branch**: Can be configured for staging deployments
- **Feature branches**: Create preview deployments for testing

### Monitoring Deployments

- **Vercel Dashboard**: View all deployments and their status
- **GitHub Integration**: See deployment status directly in pull requests
- **Email Notifications**: Get notified of successful/failed deployments

## Step 4: Production Checklist

Before going live with real users:

### Technical Verification
- [ ] All environment variables set correctly in production
- [ ] Database migrations applied to production Supabase instance
- [ ] Custom domain working (if configured)
- [ ] HTTPS certificate active
- [ ] All pages load correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified
- [ ] Core user flows tested in production

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Image optimization enabled
- [ ] Core Web Vitals scores acceptable
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] Database queries optimized
- [ ] API response times acceptable

### Security & Compliance
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in client-side code
- [ ] API routes properly secured
- [ ] Database RLS policies active
- [ ] CORS configuration correct
- [ ] Privacy policy and terms of service (if required)

## Advanced Configuration

### Multiple Environments

**Staging Environment:**
- Deploy `develop` branch to `staging.yourdomain.com`
- Use separate Supabase project for testing
- Test new features before production release

**Preview Deployments:**
- Every pull request gets a unique preview URL
- Perfect for reviewing changes before merging
- Automatically cleaned up when PR is closed

### Custom Domains Strategy

**Subdomain Ideas:**
- `app.yourdomain.com` - Main application
- `api.yourdomain.com` - API endpoints (if separate)
- `blog.yourdomain.com` - Marketing/blog content
- `admin.yourdomain.com` - Admin dashboard

### Analytics and Monitoring

**Vercel Analytics** (Recommended):
- Built-in performance monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- User behavior insights
- Zero configuration required

**Third-party Options:**
- Google Analytics 4 for detailed user analytics
- Hotjar for user behavior heatmaps
- Sentry for error monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Test locally first
npm run build

# Check specific error in Vercel logs
# Fix issues and redeploy
```

**Environment Variable Issues:**
- Ensure all required variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- Variable names must match exactly (including NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
- Redeploy after adding/changing environment variables

**Domain Connection Problems:**
- Verify DNS records are correct and have propagated (24-48 hours)
- Check SSL certificate status in Vercel dashboard
- Try incognito mode to avoid browser caching

**Database Connection Errors:**
- Verify Supabase URLs point to correct project
- Check database connection limits and usage
- Ensure RLS policies allow your application access
