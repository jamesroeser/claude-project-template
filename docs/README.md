## How These Documents Work Together

### 1. Project Setup (QNEW Process)
During your initial setup, Claude Code will customize these documents based on your project idea:
- **master-project-context.md** becomes your project's "brain"
- **mvp-features.md** gets tailored to your specific application type
- **claude-code-context.md** provides complete technical context

### 2. Daily Development
These documents guide your ongoing development workflow:
- **development-cheatsheet.md** for quick command reference
- **cto-ceo-workflow.md** for collaboration process
- **development-best-practices.md** for code quality standards

### 3. Strategic Planning
Use these for business and technical planning:
- **master-project-context.md** for strategic decisions with Claude Web
- **prd-template.md** for documenting new features
- **mvp-features.md** for development prioritization

### 4. Deployment & Growth
These support your production deployment:
- **deployment-guide.md** for hosting and domain setup
- Technical guides for scaling and performance optimization

## Document Maintenance

### Automatic Updates
Claude Code automatically updates these documents during development:
- Progress tracking in master-project-context.md
- Technical decisions and architecture changes
- Feature completion status and next steps

### Manual Updates
You should manually update:
- Business requirements and strategic changes
- User feedback and market insights
- Performance metrics and success criteria

### Claude Web Synchronization
**Important**: Download the updated `master-project-context.md` periodically and upload it to your Claude Web project knowledge base to keep strategic planning synchronized with technical progress.

## Getting Started

1. **Read First**: Start with `master-project-context.md` for complete project overview
2. **Setup Process**: Follow `BEGINNERS - START HERE.md` in the root directory
3. **Daily Reference**: Use `development-cheatsheet.md` for quick command lookup
4. **Workflow**: Follow `cto-ceo-workflow.md` for development collaboration

## Document Customization

All documents in this folder are templates that will be customized during your project setup to include:
- Your specific project vision and requirements
- Your chosen application type and features
- Your business model and success metrics
- Your technical architecture and implementation details

The customization ensures every document is relevant to your specific project rather than generic template content.
