```
I'm using the professional development template and need to set up my new project. Please read CLAUDE.md to understand the template structure, then execute the QNEW workflow to:

1. Verify all systems (GitHub CLI, API keys, npm scripts)
2. Guide me through MVP-focused project discovery 
3. Create initial GitHub issues for development
4. Set up my CEO workflow preferences
5. Customize all documentation for my specific project

This is a completely fresh template setup. Please start with system verification before proceeding with project customization.
```

### C. Follow the Guided Onboarding

**Claude Code will ask you MVP-focused questions:**

1. **"What's your project idea? Describe your vision and core value proposition."**
   - Be honest and detailed about what you want to build
   - Explain who your target users are and what problem you're solving

2. **"What type of project is this? (SaaS platform, mobile app, productivity tool, etc.)"**
   - Choose the category that best fits your idea

3. **"What should we call this project?"**
   - Choose your project name (can be changed later)

4. **"Domain name (OPTIONAL - you can set this up later if desired)"**
   - Leave blank if unsure, you can add later

**MVP Focus Guidance**: If you provide expansive ideas, Claude Code will respond: "Great vision! As your CTO, I need to help you focus on a strong foundational MVP first. Let's identify the 3 core features that prove your concept."

**CEO Control Preferences**: Claude Code will ask: "Do you want me to automatically approve and close issues after implementation, or would you prefer to review and approve everything yourself?"

- **Auto-approval**: "Faster development, I handle technical decisions"
- **Manual approval**: "You maintain control, learn more about technical decisions"

### D. System Verification Process

Claude Code will automatically verify:
- ‚úÖ GitHub CLI installation and authentication (`gh auth status`)
- ‚úÖ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists in repository secrets
- ‚úÖ All npm scripts work: type-check, lint, build
- ‚úÖ Development server starts: `npm run dev`

   about features, user experience, market positioning, and business strategy
   for this project. Focus on user needs, market opportunities, and
   sustainable business models. Always reference the master project context
   for technical constraints and current development status.
   ```

### C. Test Strategic Planning Coordination

Ask Claude Web these questions to verify integration:
- "Based on my project context, what should be my first 3 MVP features to build?"
- "Who is my target customer and how do I reach them?"
- "What business model makes sense for this project type?"

**‚úÖ Verification**: Claude Web responds with context-aware strategic advice

**‚ùå "qnew command not found" or Claude Code doesn't recognize shortcuts**

```bash
# Verify you're in the right directory with CLAUDE.md
ls -la CLAUDE.md    # Should exist
pwd                 # Should show your project directory

# If CLAUDE.md missing or you're in wrong directory
cd ~/Documents/Projects/your-project-name
claude-code
```

**‚ùå "Exit code 1" when tagging @claude in GitHub issues**

1. **Check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY setup**:
   - Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí Actions
   - Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret exists
   - Get new key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) if needed

2. **Check API Budget**:
   - Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) ‚Üí Billing
   - Verify you have available API credits ($10+ recommended)
   - Set monthly limit to prevent overuse

3. **Test GitHub CLI**:
   ```bash
   gh auth status    # Should show "Logged in"
   gh repo view      # Should show your repo, not error
   ```

**‚ùå npm install fails**

```bash
# Clear cache and reinstall
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
node --version
```

**‚ùå Development server won't start**

```bash
# Try different port
npm run dev -- --port 3001

# Check for port conflicts
lsof -i :3000    # See what's using port 3000
```

**‚ùå TypeScript or build errors**

```bash
# Fix common issues
npm run lint:fix        # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format:write    # Auto-format code
npm run type-check      # Check for type errors
```

### Authentication Issues

**‚ùå GitHub CLI authentication problems**

```bash
# Re-authenticate GitHub CLI
gh auth logout
gh auth login

# Follow prompts: GitHub.com ‚Üí HTTPS ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Web browser login
```

**‚ùå Supabase connection errors**

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) ‚Üí Your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí API
2. Copy Project URL and anon key
3. Update `.env.local` with correct values:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```
4. Restart development server: `npm run dev`

**‚ùå Vercel deployment issues**

- Verify Vercel account connected to same GitHub account
- Check repository is public or Vercel has access
- Verify environment variables copied to Vercel dashboard

### Git and Repository Issues

**‚ùå Git repository connection problems**

```bash
# Check current remote
git remote -v

# Should show YOUR repository, not the template
# If wrong, fix it:
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/your-repo.git
git push -u origin main
```

**‚ùå Can't push to repository**

```bash
# Check if you have write access
gh repo view your-username/your-repo

# If using organization, make sure you're an owner/admin
```

### Claude Code Issues

**‚ùå Claude Code not detecting this is a template**

- Verify `PROJECT_NAME` placeholders still exist in key files:
  - `CLAUDE.md` (line 1)
  - `package.json` (name field)
  - `docs/master-project-context.md` (title)
- If partially set up, restore placeholders and run setup again

**‚ùå System verification failures**

1. **GitHub CLI**: `brew install gh` (Mac) or reinstall GitHub CLI
2. **API Key**: Double-check ANTHROPIC_API_KEY in repository secrets
3. **npm scripts**: Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies installed
4. **Build process**: Fix any TypeScript/lint errors before continuing
