# CEO Strategic Workflow Guide

## Your New Project Management System

**IMPORTANT**: GitHub Issues is now your comprehensive project management tool for BOTH technical development and strategic business work. This is not just for developers - it's your unified command center.

## How It Works: Dual-Track System

### Technical Track (Claude Code handles these)
- `type:feature` - New features and functionality  
- `type:bug` - Bug fixes and technical issues
- `type:refactor` - Code improvements
- `type:testing` - Quality assurance
- `type:deployment` - Infrastructure and hosting

### Strategic Track (YOU handle these with Claude Web)
- `type:strategy` - Business strategy and planning
- `type:marketing` - Marketing strategy and user acquisition  
- `type:finance` - Business model, pricing, revenue
- `type:research` - User research and market analysis
- `type:operations` - Process improvements and team building
- `type:planning` - Product roadmap and feature prioritization

## Your Daily CEO Workflow

### 1. Morning Project Review (5 minutes)
