# Design System

A comprehensive design system for consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces.

## 🎯 Overview

This design system provides the foundation for all visual design decisions in our project. It includes design principles, component specifications, and a living style guide that evolves with our product.

## 🎨 Design Principles

Our design system is built on six core principles:

1. **User-Centric Approach** - Every decision prioritizes user needs
2. **Meticulous Craft** - Attention to detail in every pixel
3. **Speed & Performance** - Fast, efficient user experiences
4. **Simplicity & Clarity** - Clear, intuitive interfaces
5. **Focus & Efficiency** - Streamlined workflows and interactions
6. **Consistency** - Predictable patterns and behaviors

## 📖 How to Use

### For Designers
1. **Reference First**: Always check `design-principles.md` and `style-guide.md` before starting new designs
2. **Visual Guide**: Open `style-guide.html` in your browser for interactive component examples
3. **Stay Updated**: This is a living system - check for updates regularly

### For Developers
1. **Implementation Guide**: Use `style-guide.md` for exact specifications
2. **Component Library**: Reference the HTML/CSS in `style-guide.html` for implementation
3. **Design Tokens**: Use CSS custom properties from `styles/design-system.css`
4. **Validation**: Always test against both light and dark modes

## 🔧 Quick Start

### View the Style Guide
```bash
# Open the interactive style guide in your browser
open design-system/style-guide.html
```

### Using Design Tokens in Code
```css
/* Use our design tokens in your CSS */
.my-component {
  color: var(--text-primary);
  background: var(--bg-primary);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: var(--spacing-4) var(--spacing-6);
  transition: all var(--transition-fast);
}
```

### Component Integration
Our components are designed to work seamlessly with:
- **Tailwind CSS** - Primary styling framework
- **shadcn/ui** - Component library foundation  
- **Next.js** - React framework patterns
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe component props

## 🌓 Theme Support

The design system fully supports both light and dark modes:
- Automatic detection of user preference
- Manual theme switching capability
- All components designed for both themes
- Consistent color mapping across themes

## ♿ Accessibility Standards

All components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:
- **Color Contrast**: 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators throughout

## 🔄 Updates & Maintenance

This design system is a **living document** that evolves with our product:

### When to Update
- New component patterns emerge
- User feedback reveals usability issues
- Brand guidelines change
- Accessibility standards improve

### How to Update
1. **Propose Changes**: Create GitHub issue with proposed changes
2. **CEO Approval**: All design system changes require CEO approval
3. **Implementation**: Update files with proper documentation
4. **Communication**: Notify team of changes and migration paths

## 🎭 Component Categories
