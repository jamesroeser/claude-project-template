# PROJECT_NAME - Quality Standards & Testing Framework

**Last Updated**: [TO_BE_UPDATED_DURING_SETUP]  
**Document Version**: 1.0  
**Updated By**: Claude Code (CTO)

## Recent Updates
- v1.0: Initial quality standards framework created

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quality Gates & Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with zero errors
- **ESLint**: All rules must pass without warnings
- **Prettier**: Consistent code formatting enforced
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for critical paths
- **Performance**: All pages load under 2 seconds

### Testing Pyramid Strategy

#### Unit Tests (Foundation)
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **Coverage**: All utility functions, hooks, and business logic
- **Criteria**: Fast execution, isolated components, high coverage

#### Integration Tests (Core)
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library + MSW
- **Coverage**: API interactions, component integration, user flows
- **Criteria**: Real API behavior, cross-component functionality

#### End-to-End Tests (Critical Paths)
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Coverage**: Core user journeys, payment flows, authentication
- **Criteria**: Real browser behavior, visual validation, performance testing

## ðŸ”§ Development Quality Process

### Pre-Development (Planning)
- [ ] Feature specifications documented in `acceptance-criteria/`
- [ ] UI mockups created in `ui-specifications/`
- [ ] Technical approach approved by CEO
- [ ] Test strategy defined for feature

### During Development (Implementation)
- [ ] Test-Driven Development (TDD) followed
- [ ] Branded types used for IDs and domain objects
- [ ] Import types with `import type { ... }` syntax
- [ ] Self-explanatory code without unnecessary comments
- [ ] Progressive enhancement for accessibility

### Post-Development (Validation)
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed against acceptance criteria
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Accessibility validation completed
- [ ] Visual validation against UI specifications

## ðŸ“ˆ Quality Metrics & Monitoring

### Technical Metrics
- **Build Success Rate**: 100% (no broken builds)
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for critical paths
- **Performance Budget**: <2s page load time
- **Accessibility Score**: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### User Experience Metrics
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1
- **Error Rate**: <1% of user sessions
- **User Satisfaction**: >4.0/5.0 average rating
- **Support Ticket Volume**: <5% of active users
