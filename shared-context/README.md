# Shared Context Knowledge Base

> **Multi-Agent Coordination Hub**: This folder contains all project context shared between CEO (User), CTO (Claude Code), and CMO/CFO (Claude Web)

## üìÅ Folder Purpose

This knowledge base enables seamless coordination between:
- **CEO (User)**: Strategic vision, approval authority, business decisions
- **CTO (Claude Code)**: Technical implementation, architecture, development workflows  
- **CMO/CFO (Claude Web)**: Marketing, content, financial analysis, customer research

## üîÑ Update Workflow

**CEO Responsibility**: 
1. Download updated files from this folder after major changes
2. Upload entire folder to Claude Web project knowledge base
3. This keeps all agents synchronized on latest project context
