- [ ] Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds  
- [ ] First Input Delay (FID) under 100ms
- [ ] Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) under 0.1
- [ ] Dashboard data fetching shows loading states
- [ ] Images are optimized and lazy-loaded below the fold

### Responsive Design Requirements
- [ ] Desktop (1280px+): 4-column metric card layout
- [ ] Tablet (768px-1279px): 2-column metric card layout  
- [ ] Mobile (375px-767px): Single column stacked layout
- [ ] Navigation collapses to hamburger menu on mobile
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44px for mobile interactions
- [ ] Text remains readable at all viewport sizes

## UI Specifications

### Desktop Design
- **Mockup**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/desktop.png`
- **Viewport**: 1280px × 800px
- **Layout**: Header + sidebar navigation + main content area
- **Metric Cards**: 4 cards in 2×2 grid layout

### Mobile Design  
- **Mockup**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/mobile.png`
- **Viewport**: 375px × 812px
- **Layout**: Header with hamburger menu + stacked content
- **Metric Cards**: Single column, full width

### Interactive States
- **Hover States**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/states/hover.png`
- **Loading States**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/states/loading.png`
- **Empty States**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/states/empty.png`
- **Error States**: `ui-specifications/dashboard/states/error.png`

## Technical Requirements

### Component Architecture
- [ ] Uses shadcn/ui Card component as base with design system customizations
- [ ] Metric cards implemented as reusable `<MetricCard>` component
- [ ] Navigation uses existing `<Navigation>` component
- [ ] User avatar uses existing `<UserAvatar>` component
- [ ] Loading states use design system skeleton components

### Design System Compliance
- [ ] All colors use CSS custom properties from `design-system/styles/design-system.css`
- [ ] Typography follows design system scale and hierarchy
- [ ] Spacing uses design system tokens (--spacing-* variables)
- [ ] Component styling follows design system patterns
- [ ] Hover and focus states match design system specifications

### Data Integration
- [ ] Dashboard data fetched from `/api/dashboard` endpoint
- [ ] User data retrieved from authenticated session context
- [ ] Activity feed data fetched from `/api/activities` endpoint
- [ ] All API calls include proper error handling
- [ ] Loading states displayed during data fetching

### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all custom components (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for data fetching and display
- [ ] Visual regression tests for desktop and mobile layouts
- [ ] Accessibility tests using automated tools
- [ ] Performance tests for loading time requirements

## Definition of Done

### Implementation Validation
- [ ] **Visual Match**: Implementation screenshots match UI mockups exactly
- [ ] **Functionality**: All acceptance criteria manually tested and verified
- [ ] **Accessibility**: WCAG audit passes with AA compliance
- [ ] **Performance**: Core Web Vitals meet specified benchmarks
- [ ] **Quality**: All tests pass, no console errors, TypeScript compiles without warnings

### Review Process
- [ ] **Code Review**: Technical implementation reviewed by peers
- [ ] **Design Review**: Visual implementation validated using `/design-review` command
- [ ] **User Testing**: Basic user journey tested with real user workflows
- [ ] **Cross-browser**: Tested in Chrome, Firefox, Safari (desktop and mobile)

### Approval Gates
