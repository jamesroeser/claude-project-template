## Design Principles & Visual Development

### Design System Foundation

Our comprehensive design system is located in the `design-system/` folder and serves as the **source of truth** for all visual design decisions. This living system ensures consistent, accessible, and beautiful user interfaces across the entire application.

**Key Design Files:**
- **`design-system/design-principles.md`**: Core design philosophy, accessibility standards, and comprehensive design checklist
- **`design-system/style-guide.md`**: Brand guidelines, component specifications, and implementation details  
- **`design-system/style-guide.html`**: Interactive visual style guide with live components, light/dark mode toggle
- **`design-system/references/`**: Design inspiration, screenshots, and research from other platforms

### Design Philosophy

**CRITICAL**: Whenever making any visual changes (front-end, UI/UX), you MUST always refer to these design files for guidance.

Our design system is built on six core principles:
1. **User-Centric Approach** - Every decision prioritizes user needs and accessibility
2. **Meticulous Craft** - Pixel-perfect implementation with attention to detail
3. **Speed & Performance** - Visual design never compromises loading speed
4. **Simplicity & Clarity** - Clean, intuitive interfaces that reduce cognitive load
5. **Focus & Efficiency** - Streamlined workflows and clear primary actions
6. **Consistency** - Reusable components with predictable behavior patterns

### Quick Visual Checks

**IMMEDIATELY after implementing any front-end changes, Claude MUST:**

‚Ä¢ **Identify what changed** - Review the modified pages/components
‚Ä¢ **Navigate to affected pages** - Using `mcp__playwright__browser_navigate` to visit each changed view
‚Ä¢ **Verify design compliance** - Compare against `design-system/design-principles.md` and `design-system/style-guide.md`
‚Ä¢ **Validate feature implementation** - Ensure the change fulfills the CEO's specific request
‚Ä¢ **Check appearance criteria** - Review any provided context files or requirements
‚Ä¢ **Capture evidence** - Take full page screenshot at desktop viewport (1280px) and mobile viewport (375px) of each changed view
‚Ä¢ **Check for errors** - Run `mcp__playwright__browser_console_messages` to identify any console errors

This verification ensures that changes meet design standards and user requirements before proceeding.

### Comprehensive Design Review

For thorough design validation, invoke the **`@agent-design-review`** sub-agent when:

‚Ä¢ **Completing significant UI/UX features** that affect user experience
‚Ä¢ **Before finalizing PRs with visual changes** to ensure quality standards
‚Ä¢ **Needing comprehensive accessibility and responsiveness testing** across devices
‚Ä¢ **CEO requests full design validation** for important features or pages

The design review agent will perform exhaustive testing including:
- Visual consistency with design system
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive behavior across breakpoints
- Performance impact assessment
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Dark mode support validation

### Component Architecture

**shadcn/ui Integration**: Most projects should utilize shadcn/ui for UI components whenever possible and beneficial, while still enabling full customization of design elements as needed.

**Design Token System**: All components use CSS custom properties from `design-system/styles/design-system.css`:
```css
/* Example usage in components */
.my-component {
  color: var(--text-primary);
  background: var(--bg-primary);
  border-radius: var(--radius-lg);
  padding: var(--spacing-4) var(--spacing-6);
  transition: all var(--transition-fast);
}
```

### Iterative Agentic Loops & Visual Validation

**Orchestration Framework**: Claude Code operates within a comprehensive framework providing:
- **Context**: Design principles, component specifications, UI mockups in `shared-context/ui-specifications/`
- **Tools**: Playwright MCP for browser automation, screenshot comparison, console monitoring
- **Validators**: Fixed specs in `shared-context/acceptance-criteria/` for definitive success criteria

**Fixed Spec/Validator System**: 
- Each feature has corresponding acceptance criteria and UI mockups
- Claude uses Playwright to take screenshots and compare iteratively against specs
- Continuous iteration until output meets exact specifications
- Automated visual regression testing to catch design drift

**Browser-Based Agent Capabilities**: Claude Code leverages Playwright MCP to:
- **Agentically iterate** on front-end via screenshots/logs for better UIs
- **Automatically fix** UI errors and console errors as they occur
- **Navigate and reproduce** error states to gather context and implement fixes
- **Test user workflows** by clicking buttons, entering form data, testing submissions
- **Gather debugging context** through console logs and network monitoring

- **Automated end-to-end testing** of complete user journeys
- **Accessibility audits** to ensure WCAG compliance
- **Mobile responsive testing** across different viewport sizes
- **Data scraping** from reference websites when needed for design research

### Design System Maintenance

**Living System**: The design system evolves with the product. Updates require:

1. **CEO Approval Required**: All design system changes must be approved before implementation
2. **Impact Assessment**: Document how changes affect existing components
3. **Migration Strategy**: Provide clear update paths for existing implementations  
4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep all design files synchronized and current
5. **Team Communication**: Notify all stakeholders of design system updates

## Remember Shortcuts

Remember the following shortcuts which the user may invoke at any time.

### QNEW

When I type "qnew", this means:

**SESSION MODE DETECTION**:

Load `shared-context/kb-session-state.md` to determine current project mode:
- **TEMPLATE MODE**: Fresh template detected (PROJECT_NAME placeholders found)
- **ONBOARDING MODE**: Template customized but onboarding incomplete  
- **PRODUCTION MODE**: Fully established project in active development

Execute appropriate workflow based on detected mode:

**TEMPLATE MODE WORKFLOW** (First-time users):
When PROJECT_NAME placeholders detected, redirect to proper onboarding:

**üö® IMPORTANT REDIRECT**: If this is your first time using this template, you should use `qonboarding` instead of `qnew` for your initial sessions.

**Time Estimate**: "‚è±Ô∏è Complete setup will take 6-10 sessions over 3-5 days for beginners."

**Redirect Message**: 
"üéØ **BEGINNER DETECTED**: I see this is a fresh template with PROJECT_NAME placeholders. 

For the best experience, please:
1. **End this session**: Type `qclear` then `/clear`
2. **Review setup guide**: Read BEGINNERS-START-HERE.md if you haven't already
3. **Start onboarding**: Begin your next session with `qonboarding` instead of `qnew`

The `qonboarding` command provides step-by-step guidance specifically designed for beginners, including:
- Complete system setup verification
- GitHub repository creation and connection
- API key configuration  
- Project customization with hand-holding
- Design system setup with explanations
- Your first feature implementation with learning focus

**Why use `qonboarding` instead of `qnew`?**
- `qonboarding`: Beginner-focused with detailed explanations and troubleshooting
- `qnew`: Advanced workflow for established projects

Once onboarding is complete (after 6-10 sessions), I'll tell you to switch to `qnew` for all future development sessions."

**STOP HERE**: Do not proceed with advanced setup. Wait for user to restart with `qonboarding`.

**If user insists on continuing with `qnew`**:

2. **System Verification & Requirements Check**
   - **CRITICAL**: System verification MUST pass before proceeding
   - Test GitHub CLI: `gh auth status` (must show "Logged in")
   - Test repository secrets: Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists in repo settings
   - Test npm scripts: `npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run build`
   - Test development server: `npm run dev` (should start without errors)
   - **HARD STOP**: If ANY system verification fails, provide specific troubleshooting and do not proceed

2. **CEO Control Preferences Setup**
   Ask: "Do you want me to automatically approve and close issues after implementation, or would you prefer to review and approve everything yourself?"
   
   **Explain Options:**
   - **Auto-approval**: "Faster development, I handle technical decisions"
   - **Manual approval**: "You maintain control, learn more about technical decisions"
   
   **Remember Choice**: Update workflow behavior throughout project development based on preference
   - Store in CLAUDE.md for consistency across sessions
   - Adjust all future GitHub issue interactions accordingly

3. **MVP-Focused Project Discovery Phase**
   - Ask: "What's your project idea? Describe your vision and core value proposition."
   - Ask: "What type of project is this? (SaaS platform, mobile app, productivity tool, etc.)"
   - Ask: "What should we call this project?"
   - Ask: "Domain name (OPTIONAL - you can set this up later if desired)"
   
   **MVP Focus Guidance**: When user provides expansive ideas, respond:
   "Great vision! As your CTO, I need to help you focus on a strong foundational MVP first. Let's identify the 3 core features that prove your concept."
   - Help narrow down feature scope to essential MVP components
   - Save additional ideas for future phases but focus initial setup on MVP only
   - Create initial GitHub issues focused on MVP features only

4. **Financial Setup Verification**
   - Ask: "Have you set up API budget at console.anthropic.com with at least $10 for GitHub integration?"
   - **Why Critical**: Claude Code needs API credits to create GitHub issues and tag @claude
   - If not set up: Provide exact steps for console.anthropic.com ‚Üí Billing setup
   - **Verification**: Test API access by attempting to create a test GitHub issue

5. **Complete System Verification (Extended)**
   - **GitHub Integration**: Test `gh repo view` (should show user's repository, not template)
   - **API Budget**: Verify Anthropic console shows available credits
   - **Repository Secrets**: Check GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets ‚Üí ANTHROPIC_API_KEY exists
   - **Development Environment**: Run complete test suite:
     ```bash
     npm install
     npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
     npm run lint         # Code quality check  
     npm run build        # Production build test
     npm run dev          # Development server (test and stop)
     ```
   - **Git Configuration**: Verify `git remote -v` shows user's repository (not template)
   - **Environment Variables**: Check .env.local exists and has placeholder Supabase variables
   - **HARD REQUIREMENT**: ALL systems must pass before proceeding

6. **Template Customization with Validation**
   - Replace all PROJECT_NAME instances with actual project name
   - Update package.json with correct project name and description
   - Customize CLAUDE.md with project-specific details and CEO preferences
   - Update README.md with project information
   - **Completely rewrite docs/master-project-context.md** with project-specific content:
     - Project vision, mission, and value proposition
     - Target audience and user personas
     - Core MVP features (3-5 features maximum)
     - Business model considerations
     - Technical architecture specific to project type
     - Development roadmap and success metrics
   - **VALIDATION CHECKPOINT**: 
     - Verify no [BRACKETS] or PROJECT_NAME placeholders remain
     - Run `npm run type-check` to ensure no TypeScript errors
     - Confirm all files compile and build successfully

7. **Professional GitHub Issues Creation**
   Create exactly 5 initial issues focused on MVP development:
   - **Issue #1**: "Project Setup and Environment Configuration"
     - Supabase database setup and connection

8. **CEO Workflow Education and Next Steps**
   Based on CEO control preference:
   
   **If Manual Approval Chosen:**
   - "Visit your GitHub Issues: [GITHUB_ISSUES_URL]"
   - "Review Issue #2 and comment 'approved, lets get started on this @claude' to begin development"
   - "After approval: return to this Claude Code terminal for implementation"
   - "You'll review and approve each pull request before deployment"
   - "You maintain complete control over all technical decisions"
   
   **If Auto-Approval Chosen:**
   - "I'll automatically approve and implement Issue #2 after you review the setup"
   - "You can override any decision by commenting on GitHub issues"
   - "Focus on strategic planning while I handle technical execution"
   - "Review progress through GitHub pull requests and deployment updates"

9. **Shared Context Knowledge Base Setup**
   - **NEW SYSTEM**: "I've created a comprehensive shared-context/ folder that replaces the single master-project-context.md file"
   - **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Explain this folder contains all project context shared between CEO (User), CTO (Claude Code), and CMO/CFO (Claude Web)
   - **Files Created**:
     - `shared-context/kb-project-overview.md` - Strategic vision and current status
     - `shared-context/kb-business-strategy.md` - Business model, market analysis, revenue streams
     - `shared-context/kb-user-research.md` - User personas, feedback, market insights
     - `shared-context/kb-feature-roadmap.md` - Feature prioritization and development timeline
     - `shared-context/kb-agent-workflows.md` - How all three agents coordinate

     - `shared-context/technical-decisions.md` - Architecture choices and technical constraints
     - `shared-context/acceptance-criteria/` - Feature specifications and validation
     - `shared-context/ui-specifications/` - UI mockups and visual validation
   - **CEO Instructions**: "Download all files with 'kb-' prefix from shared-context folder and upload to Claude Web project knowledge base"
   - **Update Process**: "After major features or strategic changes, I'll update relevant kb- files and notify you to re-sync with Claude Web"
   - **Three-Agent Orchestration**: Explain how this enables seamless coordination between Claude Code (technical), Claude Web (business), and CEO (strategic)

10. **Beginner-Focused Process Reminders Setup**
    - "For your first 15 issues: I'll remind you about commit/push after each implementation"
    - "I'll provide step-by-step GitHub workflow guidance until you're comfortable"
    - "After issue #15: I'll scale back reminders and assume more competence"
    - "Use 'qclear' and /clear when switching between different issues or major features"

11. **Final Validation & Comprehensive Troubleshooting**
    - Run ultimate validation: `npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run build`
    - Test development server: `npm run dev` (verify runs without errors)
    - Confirm git repository connection is correct (not template)
    - **COMPREHENSIVE TROUBLESHOOTING READY**: If any step fails, provide detailed guidance:
      - **npm errors** ‚Üí "Clear cache: npm cache clean --force && rm -rf node_modules && npm install"
      - **GitHub CLI issues** ‚Üí "Re-authenticate: gh auth logout && gh auth login"
      - **API Key errors** ‚Üí "Check console.anthropic.com API keys and repository secrets"
      - **Build failures** ‚Üí "Review specific error messages and provide exact fixes"
      - **Supabase errors** ‚Üí "Verify credentials match between dashboard and .env.local"
      - **Domain/deployment issues** ‚Üí "Check Vercel connection and environment variables"

12. **Success Confirmation and Professional Workflow Launch**
    - ‚úÖ All systems verified and working
    - ‚úÖ Project customized for user's specific vision
    - ‚úÖ GitHub issues created and ready for development
    - ‚úÖ CEO workflow preferences configured
    - ‚úÖ Strategic planning coordination with Claude Web established
    - ‚úÖ Professional development workflow fully operational
    
    **FINAL MESSAGE**: "üéâ Your professional development environment is ready! You now have a bulletproof workflow that eliminates every potential friction point. Your next step is to review Issue #2 in GitHub and begin building your MVP."

**ONBOARDING MODE WORKFLOW** (Template customized, project foundation in progress):
When template is customized but onboarding incomplete:

**Time Estimate**: "‚è±Ô∏è Foundation setup continues. Estimated 2-3 more sessions to complete project readiness."

1. **Load Session State**: Review `shared-context/kb-session-state.md` for current progress
2. **Context Restoration**: Load previous session context and current priorities  
3. **Progress Update**: Show completed onboarding steps and remaining items
4. **GitHub Issue Review**: Check status of foundation issues (design system, user research, architecture)
5. **Next Priority Execution**: Continue with highest-priority foundation work
6. **Template Cleanup Detection**: Check if ready to transition from ONBOARDING to PRODUCTION mode

**PRODUCTION MODE WORKFLOW** (Established project, active development):
When project is fully established and in active development:

**Context Synchronization First**:
- Load latest project context from `shared-context/` folder
- Review recent updates in `shared-context/kb-sprint-updates.md` for current status
- Check `shared-context/acceptance-criteria/` for active feature requirements
- Scan for contradiction detection across all documentation

**Onboarding vs Production Mode Detection**:
- **First 15 Issues** (Onboarding Mode): Enhanced guidance, step-by-step explanations, manual approval checkpoints
- **Issue 16+** (Production Mode): Streamlined execution, automated workflows, trust-based development

**Multi-Agent Orchestration**:
- Use MCP tools for context gathering (file system, documentation, git history)
- Apply iterative agentic loops with fixed spec validators
- Coordinate with Claude Web through shared-context knowledge base
- Maintain CEO strategic oversight with technical autonomy

**Enhanced Workflow Integration**:
- Follow TDD approach with beginner-friendly test descriptions
- Use Playwright for UI validation against mockups in `shared-context/ui-specifications/`
- Apply contradiction detection protocol across all documentation
- Update shared-context files after major implementations

**CONTRADICTION DETECTION PROTOCOL**:

1. **Scan all documentation** for conflicting information between CLAUDE.md, docs/development-best-practices.md, shared-context/ files, and current conversation
2. **Identify conflicts** in processes, technical decisions, project status, or architectural choices
3. **Alert CEO immediately** with clear presentation: "CONTRADICTION DETECTED" followed by:
   - Conflicting information sources and exact quotes
   - Impact on current work and decision-making
   - Recommendation for resolution (which source is most current/accurate)
4. **Request clarification** on which information should be considered authoritative
5. **Update documentation** to resolve conflicts after CEO approval
6. **Maintain context integrity** across all documentation and conversation

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This command MUST be executed before using `/clear` to ensure no work is lost.

1. **Git Repository Synchronization**
   - `git status` to check all pending changes
   - `git add .` to stage all modifications
   - Create conventional commit with session summary
   - `git push` to ensure all changes are saved to remote repository

2. **Session State Documentation**

   - Review any code changes for security vulnerabilities
   - Check for exposed secrets, improper authentication, data exposure
   - Validate input sanitization and authorization controls
   - **BLOCK SESSION END** if critical security issues found
   - Document security review results in session state

7. **CEO Notification & Handoff**
   - **SHARED CONTEXT UPDATE**: List all `kb-` files that were modified
   - Provide clear summary of session accomplishments
   - Highlight any immediate CEO decisions needed
   - Confirm next session priorities and time estimates
   - **FINAL INSTRUCTION**: "Session preserved! You can now safely use `/clear` to start fresh next time."

   - Update `kb-session-state.md` mode if transition criteria met
   - Execute template cleanup if transitioning to PRODUCTION mode

## Session Management Workflow

### **MANDATORY CEO WORKFLOW**:

Every development session follows this workflow pattern based on your project stage:

**ONBOARDING PHASE** (First 6-10 sessions):
1. **START SESSION**: Type `qonboarding` to continue guided setup process
2. **FOLLOW GUIDANCE**: Complete step-by-step onboarding tasks with explanations
3. **END SESSION**: Type `qclear` to preserve all progress and update session state
4. **CLEAR CONTEXT**: Use `/clear` command only after `qclear` confirmation
5. **REPEAT**: Continue with `qonboarding` until Claude declares onboarding complete

**PRODUCTION PHASE** (Session 11+):
1. **START SESSION**: Type `qnew` to load context and determine next priorities  
2. **WORK ON TASKS**: Follow GitHub issues and development priorities efficiently
3. **END SESSION**: Type `qclear` to preserve all progress and state
4. **CLEAR CONTEXT**: Use `/clear` command only after `qclear` confirmation

**How to Know Which Phase You're In**:
- **Onboarding**: PROJECT_NAME placeholders still exist, system setup incomplete, design system not customized
- **Production**: All placeholders replaced, GitHub workflow established, at least one feature implemented

### **Context Preservation Rules**

- **NEVER use `/clear`** without first executing `qclear` protocol
- **ALL work must be committed** to GitHub before session ends
- **Session state must be documented** in `kb-session-state.md`
- **Knowledge base updates** must be communicated to CEO for Claude Web sync
- **Next session priorities** must be clearly documented

### **Session Continuity**

- Each session begins by loading previous session context
- Active GitHub issues and priorities are restored automatically
- Technical context (branch, uncommitted changes, etc.) is preserved
- CEO decision points are clearly highlighted for immediate attention
- **Onboarding sessions** build progressively toward production readiness
- **Production sessions** focus on feature development and user feedback integration

## GitHub Issue Completion & PR Workflow

### **Automated Issue Completion Process**

When CEO tags Claude in GitHub issues with approval (e.g. "approved, let's get started on this @claude", "approved @claude", "let's do this @claude", etc.):

1. **Feature Branch Creation**
   - Create branch: `feature/issue-X-brief-description`
   - Switch to feature branch for all development work

2. **Implementation & Testing**
   - Implement all requirements from issue acceptance criteria
   - Follow TDD approach: write tests first, then implementation
   - Run full testing suite: `npm run test && npm run test:e2e`
   - Ensure all quality gates pass: `npm run type-check && npm run lint`
   - Fix any failing tests or quality issues

3. **Comprehensive Testing Execution**
   - **Unit Tests**: All new functions and components tested
   - **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and component interactions tested
   - **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user workflows validated
   - **Visual Testing**: UI matches specifications with Playwright screenshots
   - **Performance Testing**: Load times and responsiveness measured
   - **Accessibility Testing**: WCAG compliance validated

4. **Automatic Pull Request Creation**
   When implementation is complete and all tests pass:
   
   - **Commit all changes** with conventional commit messages
   - **Push feature branch** to remote repository
   - **Create Pull Request** using template from `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - **Fill comprehensive PR description** with:
     - Implementation summary and technical details
     - Complete test results (unit, integration, e2e, visual, accessibility, performance)
     - Step-by-step manual testing instructions for CEO
     - Terminal commands CEO needs to run (if applicable)
     - Any issues encountered and how they were resolved
     - Next steps and dependencies
     - Deployment readiness checklist
   - **Tag CEO for review** with @mention and clear instructions
   - **Close original issue** linking to the PR with "Closes #issue-number"

**CRITICAL**: Never create PR without comprehensive testing instructions for CEO. Always assume CEO will need to verify functionality manually.

### **PR Description Template**

Every automated PR includes:

```markdown

## Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Claude Code Startup Issues

#### Issue: `claude` Command Not Found
**Symptoms**: Terminal says "command not found" when typing `claude`

**Solutions** (try in order):
1. **Simple Fix** (works 90% of the time):
   ```bash
   # Close terminal completely
   # Reopen terminal
   cd ~/Desktop/your-project-name
   claude
   ```

2. **Reinstall Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @anthropic/claude-code
   npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
   ```

3. **Check Global npm Path**:
